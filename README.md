# sfcommmultiattachdownloader

Background
I worked on a community that requried user to able to download the attachments. After giving the required permissions for community profile, I realized user cant download multiple attachments. After googling found this [article](http://www.saaspie.com/download-attachments-as-a-zip-file-in-salesforce/). Using that I wrote the code and wanted to share it.
